### Oh Hi, Marc 👋😉

Hey there, my name is Marc. By day, I work to ensure the systems behind [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) are 🏃 fast, 💪 reliable, and 🌪️ resilient to failure.

When I'm not on the clock, I enjoy working on 💻 side projects, 🥘 cooking, and 🛠️ DIY projects around the house. You can check out my hot takes on [🐦 Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbillow), my adventures on [📸 Instagram](https://instagram.com/mbillow), or my professional life on [💼 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbillow).
