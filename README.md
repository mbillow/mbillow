### Howdy! 🤠

Hey there, my name is Marc. By day, I work to ensure the systems behind [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) are 🏃 fast, 💪 reliable, and 🌪️ resilient to failure. My passion is creating simple, self-service systems and interfaces that make deployment and runtime complexities invisible.

My teams own and operate the underlying compute infrastructure that powers nearly all of Indeed's functionality. Every day we leverage and help drive innovation within ☁️ AWS, ☸️ Kubernetes, 🔐 Vault, 🌐 Envoy, and countless other projects and platforms.

When I'm not on the clock, I enjoy working on 💻 side projects, 🥘 cooking, and 🛠️ DIY projects around the house. You can check out my adventures on [📸 Instagram](https://instagram.com/mbillow) or my professional life on [💼 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbillow).
